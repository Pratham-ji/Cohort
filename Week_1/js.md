      this.name = name;
  }
  Person.prototype.greet = function() {
      console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
  };
  const john = new Person("John");
  john.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, John
  ```

- **The `this` Keyword**: Refers to the context in which a function is called. Its value can change based on how a function is invoked.
  ```javascript
  const obj = {
      name: "Alice",
      greet: function() {
          console.log("Hello, " + this.name);
      }
  };
  obj.greet(); // Outputs: Hello, Alice
  ```

#### 17. **Event Loop and Concurrency Model**
